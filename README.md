# dynamicmazeVEXcode
VEXcode VR Dynamic Maze-solving Robot ü§ñ	
## üìå Overview
This project is a **dynamic maze-solving robot** programmed in **Python using VEXcode VR**.  
The robot navigates through a **dynamic maze**, detects walls, avoids obstacles, reaches a **goal tile (red)** and returns to **home**.  

It then **returns to its starting position**, drawing its path in different colours:  
- ** Blue** for the path towards the goal.  
- ** Green** for the return path.

## üéØ Features
‚úÖ Uses a **wall-following algorithm** to explore the maze.  
‚úÖ Avoids revisiting the same path using a **loop-detection mechanism**.  
‚úÖ **Changes pen colour dynamically**:  
   - **Blue** when reaching the goal.  
   - **Green** when returning to the starting position.
   - It will print the total number of unique movements the robot has made since it started moving.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. The robot starts from **home** inside the maze.
2. It follows the **left-wall-following algorithm** to navigate.
3. The robot will explore the maze till it reaches a **red tile (goal)**.
4. It **draws its path in blue** while reaching the goal.
5. When returning back to home, **calculates the shortest way back** and **draws in green**.
